| Task                                      | Observation                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Square pulse through band-limited channel | Severe distortion, ringing, and time-spreading â‡’ causes ISI           |
| Two square pulses                         | Overlap occurs â‡’ clearly demonstrates Inter-Symbol Interference       |
| Raised Cosine pulse                       | Smoother, well-bounded spectrum â‡’ survives filtering with minimal ISI |
