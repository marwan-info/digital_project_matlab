### to overcome the isi we can use delta function 
#### delta with filter take shap of filter we can make filter square pulse so we are sure we see at reciver square pulse 
### or we can use functions which shap in frequnct domain is square pulse like this

## overlap happen but very small because we assume the filter is sharp edge filter not practical

| Square pulse through band-limited channel | Severe distortion, ringing, and time-spreading â‡’ causes ISI           |
| Two square pulses                         | Overlap occurs â‡’ clearly demonstrates Inter-Symbol Interference       |
